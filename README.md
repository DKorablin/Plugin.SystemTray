# System Tray Plugin
Sometime it's convenient to run some applications so that they do not take up space in the taskbar but will located in the system tray. That's what this plugin was created for.

When application with plugin is minimized application will be hidden from the task bar and will be available only in system tray. If you need to expand the application, just double-click on the application icon and choose Restore menu item.

For host SAL Dialog, this plugin is useless because this host is using in system tray by default.
